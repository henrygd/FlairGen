FlairGen
----------------------------

A tool that allows users of reddit's college football subreddit (/r/cfb) to easily convert text into inline flair -- that is, each letter will display as a school logo somewhat resembling that letter. The result looks like a ransom note, but it's still pretty cool. The site also includes a sandbox mode that allows users to add specific flair to regular text.
