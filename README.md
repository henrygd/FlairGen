FlairGen
----------------------------

A tool that allows users of reddit's college football subreddit ([/r/cfb](http://reddit.com/r/cfb/)) to easily convert text into inline flair -- that is, each letter will display as a school logo somewhat resembling that letter. The result looks like a ransom note, but it's still pretty neat. The site also includes a sandbox mode that allows users to add specific flair to regular text.

Feel free to use for whatever, or set up another site if the one above goes down.
